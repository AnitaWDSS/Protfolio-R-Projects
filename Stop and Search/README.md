This project seeks to research whether there is evidence of ethnic bias in three UK police forces (Lincolnshire, Cleveland and Merseyside). I defined two research questions, one for each bias metric: 

1. Is there an overproportion of stop-and-searches (relative to population) for a given 
ethnicity? 

2. Is there an underproportion of Stop-and-searches that result in further action for a 
given ethnicity? 

I concluded that the first metric shows discrimination against the black community, 
particularly in Merseyside. This is consistent between 2006 to 2021. 
The second measure, however, leaves less evidence of discrimination and results differ 
between forces. Here, urban Merseyside shows less ethnic disparity than, more rural, 
Lincolnshire and Cleveland.  

To do so, I made use of  **multi-point dumbbell plots** and **local polynomial regression models** to compare forces across time.
